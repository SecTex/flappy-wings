Flappy Wings is a canvas-based browser game with PWA capabilities, based on the popular mobile game "Flappy Bird" developed by Vietnamese game developer Dong Nguyen. The objective of the game is straightforward: players control a small bird character and must navigate it through a series of obstacles. The bird automatically moves forward, and players can make it flap its wings by tapping on the screen or pressing a button. Each flap causes the bird to ascend slightly, and when the player stops tapping, the bird descends due to gravity.
